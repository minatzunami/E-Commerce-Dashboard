# E-Commerce Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project features an interactive **Power BI dashboard** built using the **Adventure Works** dataset to provide actionable business insights across **product performance, customer behavior, and store-level results**.

The dashboard leverages **Power Query** to compute key financial metrics, including **Total**, **Average**, **Year-over-Year (YoY)**, and **Month-over-Month (MoM)** revenue and profit. Comprehensive data cleaning and transformation were performed to ensure the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of all reported metrics.

Through intuitive visualizations and drill-down capabilities, the dashboard supports data-driven decision-making by enabling users to explore performance trends and identify key business drivers.
